# Basic Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to use the TR-069 Wildcard Expander library in an external Go project.

## Running the Example

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

## What This Example Shows

1. **Single Wildcard Expansion**: How to expand a path with one wildcard
2. **Multi-level Wildcard Expansion**: How to handle paths with multiple wildcards
3. **Error Handling**: Common error scenarios and how to handle them

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Creating and releasing expanders using the pool
- Iterative discovery process
- Registering discovered indices
- Handling empty discovery results
- Error handling for invalid paths and mismatched registrations

## Expected Output

The example will show:
- Discovery paths generated by the expander
- Simulated discovery results (indices found)
- Final expanded parameter paths
- Error handling examples

This demonstrates the complete workflow for integrating the library into a TR-069 client application.
